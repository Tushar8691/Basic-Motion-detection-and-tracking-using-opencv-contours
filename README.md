# Basic-Motion-detection-and-tracking-using-opencv-contours

It involves capturing video frames, converting them to grayscale, and applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise. By computing the absolute difference between frames, significant changes indicating motion are detected. A binary threshold is applied to highlight these changes. Contours are then found within these highlighted areas, representing the boundaries of moving objects. These contours can be used to track the objects' positions over time, allowing for basic motion detection and tracking in the video.
